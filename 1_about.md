Hi there!

I'm Carlos Mellado, iOS Lead at [Zeelo](https://zeelo.co).
As you may read at the footer of this page, I really love to developing and learn new things about this world.

I'm really interested in iOS, Arduino/harware and other platforms. 
I've been working as a developer from {{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 2008 }} years, and now, a lot of years ago, I decided to start writing about this.

Hope you enjoy the reading and you can learn a little bit.

Enjoy the site!
